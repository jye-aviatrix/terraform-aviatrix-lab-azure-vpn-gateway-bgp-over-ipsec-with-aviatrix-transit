# terraform-aviatrix-lab-azure-vpn-gateway-bgp-over-ipsec-with-aviatrix-transit

This module create a lab environment, intergrating Azure VPN Gateway with Aviatrix Transit via BGP over IPSec.

Last tested with:
- Terraform: v1.2.8
- azurerm provider: 3.24.0
- Aviatrix Controller: 6.8.1149
- aviatrix provider: 2.24.0

Following architecture will be deployed:

![](20220930185305.png)  

- Aviatrix Transit establish two IPSec GRE tunnels with Azure VPN Gateway, both tunnels are active and Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
- Both Express Route Gateway and VPN Gateway are also called VNET Gateway (VNG)
- Aviatrix Spoke CIDR will be propagate to Spoke vNet on bottom right via VNG
- Spoke vNet and vNG vNet CIDR gets propagated to Aviatrix Transit via VNG
- Spoke vNet peering with VNG vNet while specifying use remote virtual network's gateway
- VNG vNet peering with Spoke vNet while specifying use this virtual network's gateway
